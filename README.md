# nonogram-solver
During an Artificial Intelligence class, I developed two distinct solvers for nonogram puzzles: one using the AC-3 algorithm and the other using WalkSAT. Additionally, I created a third version in OCaml that generates all possibilities and identifies the correct solution, although the former two are significantly faster.
